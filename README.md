Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This grocery tracking app was developed for company Corner Grocer to track their daily purchases of produce in order to improve their current layout in the store. This project shows which items are purchased in chronological order, so that they can adjust the current layout in the produce section according to their customer’s needs. 

What did you do particularly well?

I believe the best part of my code was creating the methods on Python to be interpreted by C++. The task was laborious, but it was absolutely worth it, since doing the same thing on C++ required extreme knowledge in the language. I also think I did a decent job on my validations this time compared to my previous projects.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

On my Source.cpp file I had to use “cin.ignore(65535, ‘\n‘)” on lines 191, 205, 219. I tried to find a better way online, but it was all I could come up with. Maybe while learning more about C++ I will find a more professional approach.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The “printHistogram” on line 150 of Source.cpp was really hard to come up with. I was having a hard time using “ifstream”. I could not generate the frequency.dat file correctly and it took me several attempts to see it working as it should.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Definitely, the combination of the two languages was a big element of surprise this term. It was very frustrating, but also exciting to see them interacting together. And write much cleaner and easier code on Python instead of C++ was very satisfying.  

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made it easier to change input files on functions, so that you can add more data files if needed. I have also made independent functions for each step I found necessary; splitting them made it much easier to execute and to work with. It is also more readable since I did not have enormous blocks of code. It is very adaptable because I cannot break a function if new values are needed in the future. Instead, the person can just use the function they are interested in alone.
